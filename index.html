		<h2>How I got into programming:</h2>
			<p>	My interest in programing stems from my love of video games, which started when i got my NES at 4 years old, and my interest in technology that came from watching science shows and various pieces of Sic-Fi media. I read a few code books in middle school, but my first real practice came from a high school course in BASIC. Although most of it didn't stick it helped me grasp important concepts. My next foray was when i joined my high school's robotics team i tried to learn coding under the teams current programmers, but most were too busy working on code for the robot to teach someone with no prior experience. What i did get were introductions to C and C++, the latter becoming my favorite language to study for whatever reason. After high-school i felt disappointed in myself I hadn't learned more so I tried courses at PCC. There things came faster and i felt more accomplished when i finished a program that gave me issues. As classes went on I got in touch with a program called Fidgetech that helped provide tutoring and educational assistance to autistic young-adults looking into tech savvy careers. Their mentoring allowed me to slowly push out of my comfort zone and learn other languages. Then in early 2017 my mom referred me to Epicodus, a few months later and i managed to sign up for my first class here. </p>
		
		<h2>More about me:</h2>
			<p>Besides video games, I enjoy building models from time time and playing various board and card games, as well as 3d modeling with blender (though I'm still pretty clueless when it comes to more detailed models). Thus far I've managed to learn Java, Python, C++, C#* and a bit of BASH script* languages. Right now my hope for the future is simply to be hired by a company that will pay me to use the tools and skills I learn here.</p>
